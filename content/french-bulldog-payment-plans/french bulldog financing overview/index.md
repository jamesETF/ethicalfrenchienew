We get it, the economy is up and down, and the mortgage is due. For this reason (and by request) we have teamed up with Community Finance (others pending) to offer you a quick, simple and budget friendly way to make your Frenchie family addition easy via our French bulldog financing.


This isn't just any French bulldog financing either but is financing tailored to your needs based on your budget. Once approved for a French bulldog payment plan you can pay off your pet with the same as cash option if your budget allows (by paying off early with no interest), or you can continue to make payments until your purchase is paid off. You can also finance part of your purchase and pay the difference with cash or credit card.
Anyone interested in availabe financing should consider that we do require a nominal deposit to hold a puppy until its reached 8-12 weeks. And if you’re looking to take home a “ready for home” Frenchie, there will be a deposit required while we await the results so that we can ensure that your baby doesn’t leave with another family. However just to be sure, try not to place a deposit until your application is verified and approved.   In general, all deposits are non-refundable unless for some reason we determine that you may not be a good fit.
You can click the “Apply” button to the left or the link down below and get pre-approved with their quick and easy process, because sometimes making a monthly payment is much easier on the wallet.  Also you can afford to get more Frenchie puppy toys!


You can click the links below and complete your application on line from the convenience of your own home and get pre approved before you even stop in to see which new addition to your family you want to bring home! So simple and very budget friendly, because sometimes making a monthly payment is much more affordable.
