Newborn **French Bulldog puppies** require extra care. The first 10 days of their life are crucial. Puppies can fade away in an instant if you aren’t present at all times. Making sure they eat every 2 hours, that their temperature doesn’t drop, that they are all gaining weight equally and of course just observing their overall behavior – not missing something that would indicate a major health issue.

But of course, the whole process of **_“producing a healthy French Bulldog”_** starts way before they are even conceived. Health testing the parents is the responsible thing to do. The last thing you would want is take a risk of dam or sire being a carrier or them having some kind of hereditary condition, that would only bring heartbreak and vet bills to the new potential family.

After the **French bulldog puppies** are old enough, they get their first extensive vet visit. Only after their well being is confirmed and documented is when we start advertising our puppies/taking deposits.
