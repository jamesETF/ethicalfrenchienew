The socialization of your **French Bulldog puppy** starts early. Since they are raised inside the house they get exposed to variety of sounds and people as soon as their “ears open” at around 10-14 days of age.

_Yes, all puppies are born deaf and blind_ – they rely on their sense of smell to crawl around and find their mother during “feeding time”.

It’s hard to believe but some **puppies** show their dominance and alpha qualities at a very early age. We pay special attention to those and make sure we don’t enforce those traits. We try to establish ourselves as the leader of the pack, which will make your training easier once the **puppy** is in your care.

By the time they are ready they understand the concept of peeing on the pee pad and those that stay with us longer are familiar with the “potty” command. Some are more stubborn than others, so consistency with training is key.

Overall exposing the **French Bulldog puppies** to positive and versatile experiences is what will predispose them to grow into stable, happy individuals with the absence of phobias and behavioral issues.
