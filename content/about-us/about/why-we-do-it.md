We started **Ethical Frenchie** because of what we saw as a lack of transparency and the proliferation of scam artists taking advantage of people when they are most vulnerable. 

[**_You can read a bit more about French Bulldogs Scams and how to avoid them by clicking here._**](https://ethicalfrenchie.com/4-signs-of-a-french-bulldog-scam-and-4-ways-you-can-avoid-them-ethical-frenchie/ "French Bulldog Scams")

We also breed to better the breed. Most of our dogs are sold as pet only. We won’t offer **full AKC registration** on each and every puppy – that’s not a responsible thing to do. We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out.

Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a **full AKC registration** to get more money. _Not all dogs are meant to be bred_ (some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the **“standard” French Bulldog** look), _and not all people are qualified to breed_ (it's irresponsible to give full breeding rights to every person that inquires about them).

**Blue French Bulldog puppies for sale** as well as other exotic colors require an extensive manual registration process, for that reason we - **from this point on, don’t provide AKC registration on French Bulldogs that are sold solely as family pets. AKC registration will only be provided for a French Bulldog bought with full rights and intention to breed/show.**

**Full AKC** will also only be offered to an ethical, in house **breeder**, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.
