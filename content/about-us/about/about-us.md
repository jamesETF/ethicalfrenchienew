Hi! We’re James & Renee, nice to meet you. We are a small, **exclusive French Bulldog breeder** located on the East Coast. Our **breeding** program is focused on extra care, socialization and improving the breed. We aren’t your typical “Mom and Pops breeder” that has been around for 20 years.

We started breeding French Bulldogs 3 years ago but expanded our program in 2018. We are responsible, knowledgeable and caring which makes us stand out in the sea of faulty backyard breeders and puppy mills.

Our Female **French Bulldog** moms live happy lives and tend to have 1-2 litters only, before getting spayed. We breed standard French Bulldog colors, as well as exotic. If you are interested in **blue French Bulldog puppies for sale** – we tend to have a couple of these beautiful litters per year.
