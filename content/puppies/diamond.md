Let’s explain our background really quick. We are a couple hobby breeder, that strives to provide health, happy puppies, that will bring joy and excitement to any family. Our live is divided between North Carolina and New York City, due to our regular job, so puppies can be picked up at both placed.

Our boy Charlie really makes the most gorgeous blue French Bulldog puppies. Diamond is just another example or an adorable, compact blue French Bulldog puppy from our breeding program.

### Personality

Diamond is definitely full of attitude. She will tell you what she wants, when she wants it, and you won’t be able to say no. She’s smart and sassy, and her potty training habits should be easily established. She will do everything for a treat, including potty outside without any issues.

We are being very selective to who gets Diamond. We want to find her a home with humans that searched for specifically what she is: a loving, needy, playful, smart attentive blue Frenchie puppy that needs lost of cuddles and attention. She also loves running through the woods, so if you are looking for French Bulldog Puppies for sale NC, she might just be the right choice for your family.

### Health

We focus on health first. We health test the parents before ever considering breeding them and make sure no genetic issues derive from the bloodline. That way we produce healthy puppies, without hereditary issues. If you are looking for French Bulldog puppies for sale NC or New York City, you probably already did your research and know they don’t do well in the heat. So during the hot New York summer, they should be chilling under the AC and not be exposed to the hot temperatures. They have issues with regulating body temperature and overheating can be fatal for a French Bulldog puppy. She’s up to date on her shots, dewormings, vet checked, microchipped and ready to meet her new family!

Blue French Bulldog Puppies for sale are not that hard to find – what is hard to find is an ethical breeder that will deliver a French Bulldog puppy that will fit your family and cause no behavioral issues.
