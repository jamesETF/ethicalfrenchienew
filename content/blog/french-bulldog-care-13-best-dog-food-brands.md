## **First step to responsible French Bulldog care is picking the right food. Here are the 13 best dog food brands we swear by.**

**Yes, kibble is very convenient and that’s what a big portion of dogs owners worldwide feeds, but is it really the best option for your dog?**

**Dogs just like humans, require fresh food to thrive. Your French Bulldog will experience less issues if fed a high quality diet. Below you can find some examples of high quality kibble, if anything else is out of the budget, but also some other variations that I would personally recommend when it comes to French Bulldog care. If you decide to feed a high quality kibble make sure you still add some fresh ingredients like carrots, blueberries, spinach, etc. to your dogs diet.**

**Here are a few dog food brands, we trust for our French Bulldog adults, as well as puppies.**

## Fromm

![Fromm Salmon Dog  Food](/images/Fromm-Salmon-Dog-Food.jpg "Fromm-Salmon-Dog-Food")

Fromm dog food is made to support the all breeds in all stages of life. Made with high amounts of protein and paired with fresh produce including broccoli and carrots to provide high quality, easily digestible carbohydrates. Fromm provides well rounded, balanced nutrition for your furry friend without the unnecessary fillers. Not all French Bulldogs do good on Chicken, so Fromm comes with different animal protein variations.

## Honest Kitchen

![The Honest Kitchen](/images/the-honest-kitchen.jpg "the-honest-kitchen")

An all time favorite in our household that actually decreased shedding and flatulence. The Honest Kitchen Beef Recipe. It’s a dehydrated raw human grade food in a form of a powder that you rehydrate with warm water. You can always add some fresh blueberries, chia seeds and other vegetables to your dogs meal. When i decided to write the 13 best dog food brands post, Honest Kitchen was probably the first one to pop up in my head.

## Open Farm Freeze Dried Raw Food

![Open Farm](/images/Open-farm.jpg "Open-farm")

Many French Bulldog owners swear by the raw diet. If you are too grossed out to actually prepare the meals yourself, you can always decide to go with many Open Farm Freeze Dried Raw Food variations. Fresh stuff, no fillers, middle price range. Many French Bulldog owners swear that the best dog food for this breed is RAW, and I couldn’t agree more.

## Stella & Chewy's Raw Kibble Blend

![Stella Chewy Doog Food](/images/Stella-Chewy-doog-food.jpg "Stella-Chewy-Doog-Food")

I don’t personally feed my French Bulldog puppies with Stella & Chewy's, but I did hear great things about it.If the completely raw version is out of the budget, you can always buy patties or toppers that you can add to your French Bulldogs food. The example below is also an affordable option – a blend of raw and kibble.

## Farmer's Dog Fresh Delivery Service

![Farmers Dog](/images/farmers-dog.jpg "farmers-dog")

Not much to say here. Farmer’s Dog is a freshly made, dog food delivery service = AWESOME! You can set up the details, for example frequency, breed and ingredients to avoid on their website. Like I said before fresh food plays a big role in French Bulldog care , so if your budget is flexible I would definitely give this dog food a try. If not you can still use it as a meal booster only – mixed with kibble.

## Instinct

Another really good quality kibble would be Instinct. We really like this Beef raw coated Formula. Price is fair and your French Bulldog will thrive on this one for sure. No fillers that lead to allergies. I suggest you check the ingredients on the current kibble you are feeding, you might be surprised at the amount of fillers it contains. Instinct comes in a form of kibble or as a completely raw dog food option.

## My Ollie

Another dog food subscription that allows you to customize your French Bulldogs food plan. We love their Beefy Hearts Recipe that contains: **Beef, beef heart, beef kidney, sweet potato, beef liver, peas, potato, carrot, spinach, chia seed, dicalcium phosphate, sunflower oil, blueberries, calcium carbonate, fish oil (preserved with tocopherols), iodized salt, zinc gluconate, basil, rosemary, vitamin E supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), riboflavin (Vitamin B2).**

## Orijen

![Orijen Dog Food](/images/Orijen-doog-food.jpg "orijen-dog-food")

Orijen is an award winnig brand and it definitely deserves it’s place on the best dog food list. Their focus is providing the most biologically appropriate food, 85% protein – 15% vegetables ratio, without unnecessary fillers. I would definitely recommend the Orijen brand for your French Bulldogs. Unfortunately, my girls didn’t like it for some reason, but its still a high quality food.

## Zignature

![Zignature Doog Food](/images/Zignature-doog -food.jpg "zignature-doog-food")

Zignature is formulated to serve your canine companions needs by delivering the highest quality, well balanced diets. Zignature’s limited ingredient formula uses No Potatoes, No Grain, No Chicken, No Eggs, No Glutens, No Tapioca, No Corn & No Soy. Their Single Animal Protein Formulas are extremely palatable which encourages a healthy appetite to provide high-quality protein for strong muscles. I heard many French Bulldog owners rave about the fish based formulas like Catfish and Salmon and Trout limited ingredient formula. You should definitely give it a try if you have a French Bulldog that’s struggling with allergies.

## Nutro

![Nutro](/images/Nutro.jpg "Nutro")

Nutro is definitely one of the better choice if you want to offer the best French Bulldog care. I used it for quite a while for transitioning puppies to solid food. They loved it and their poops were solid. I don’t use it at this point, since I always love to switch it up and try new, small, organic dog food brands.

## Fresh Pet

![Fresh Pet Dog Food](/images/fresh-pet-dog-food.jpg "fresh-pet-dog-food")

Fresh Pet is  recommended for a sensitive breed like French Bulldog. Frenchies generally do great on home cooked food and this freshly made pet food will definitely work for your little companion. It’s also a great choice if you have a puppy that’s having difficulties producing a solid bowel movement. It is a bit on a pricey side, especially if you have multiple dogs, but it’s up to you to decide. There definitely are more affordable food brands that are just as good.

## Simply Nourish

![Simply Nourish Turkey](/images/Simply-Nourish-Turkey.jpg "simply-nourish-turkey")

Find a formula that works best for you canine friend. Made specially to support the unique needs and dietary preferences of growing puppies, it includes a superfood blend of real fruits and vegetables like peas, potatoes, carrots, spinach, sweet potato, pumpkin and blueberries for a deliciously complete and balanced meal that’s also filled with antioxidants.
