## What Human Food Can Frenchies Eat?

### Vegetables

![Fresh Vegetables](/images/Fresh-vegetables.jpg "Fresh-vegetables")

Vegetables make a part of [a healthy diet for French Bulldogs](https://frenchbulldog.nyc/the-best-dry-food-for-french-bulldogs-editors-updated-list/) due to their low contents of fat and calories. Right as they are, you need to be choosy in the type of vegetables to feed your canine.

Remember to go for entirely pup-safe veggies. Usually, raw vegetables won’t disturb the stomach of Frenchies, except for potatoes or sweet potatoes. They must be baked, boiled, or steamed beforehand. Classified into the nightshade family of plants, raw potatoes may contain a toxin called solanine. The case doesn’t apply to sweet potatoes, but you’d better avoid taking the risk of feeding them raw.

A majority of Frenchies crave for the crunchy texture of carrots, pumpkin, raw green beans, celery, spinach, Brussels sprouts, and squash. They are rich in minerals, healthy vitamins, and fiber to promote natural health.

In case the pet suffers from tummy upset as a result of eating raw veggies, you should get prepared for unpleasant farts. Alleviate the situation by steaming the vegetables first to facilitate chewing and digestion.

Avoid feeding French Bulldogs on vegetables in the allium family like shallots, onions, garlic, and chives. They are all poisonous to dog intake. If your dog eats any of them in large quantities, they are vulnerable to upset tummy issues and even anemia. Avocados are unacceptable, either given its content of the toxin persin, a great source of dog tummy irritation.

Steamed corn is okay, but never serve it with the cob left. Your pup can get choked on corn cob at any time. Since symptoms of allergy to corn are present in several dogs, be alert. Keep the amount of corn to a minimum once you detect signs of tummy upset or itchy skin in your furry friend.

### Fruits

Regarding **what human food Frenchies can eat**, fruits shouldn’t be left out. Like vegetables, there are various healthy options of fruits to feed French pups as a supplement to their diet. They will fall in love with sliced pieces of cantaloupe, apple, seedless watermelon, honeydew, and banana. With convenient bite-sized bits, blueberries and raspberries can make a ready-made treat that is appealing to dogs’ taste.

When it comes to seeded fruits like oranges, you’d better remove their peel and seeds first and cut them into small pieces before giving to your pooch.

If pitted fruits like peaches and cherries are available, pay attention to the pit, which is a potential choking hazard. Eradicate it and your dog can enjoy the fruits safely and comfortably.

Fruits do the health of Frenchies good, but overconsumption of them turns out dangerous. It can result in unpleasant farts and stomach upset. They have a specific amount of natural sugar, so you should keep them as a treat rather than replacing your pet’s diet with them.

Pineapple is safe with its rough outer peel removed. Otherwise, it can cause an intestinal blockage or scratch your little friend’s the inside mouth.

Refrain from giving him grapes. Though they are fit for dog mouths, they are one of the significant causes of kidney failure.

Watch out for legumes like beans and peas as well as cooked potatoes. There are several reports that a high intake of them can lead to numerous health issues.

### Fish

The smell of fish is attractive to dogs. Good fats and amino acids in fish supply a significant health boost for canines, notably salmon and sardines. Salmon is rich in vitamins and protein, while sardines provide extra calcium with digestible and soft bones. They are an ideal alternative to chicken and other everyday ingredients which may provoke allergic reactions.

Other shorter-lived species are edible to dogs, including ocean whitefish, herring, lake whitefish, walleye, flounder, and Arctic char. Be careful to take out bones; otherwise, they may get stuck in the mouth, throat, or stomach of the pet. In the worst scenarios, the organ wall will even get perforated.

Don’t give undercooked or uncooked fish to your furry friend. Raw fish is likely to contain harmful bacteria like listeria and salmonella. Overly consumption of fish isn’t sensible; instead, it should be confined to twice a week at most. Slowly introduce fish to dog meals to see whether that certain fish upsets the gastro-intestines.

### Turkey

Turkey occasionally appears on the package of commercial dog foods due to its richness in protein, phosphorous, and riboflavin. It can also make a nutritious part of a homemade dog food diet when cooked plain.

It isn’t toxic to canines as long as being served without garlic and seasoning. These ingredients are dangerous and a common source of stomach irritation. It would be best to remove the skin given the fat content could lead to pancreatitis.

Don’t forget to remove bones from the meat. They are brittle enough to harm dog mouth and tongue, even resulting in rectal bleeding or blockages.

### Shrimp

Besides appealing taste, shrimps are abundant in essential nutrients like niacin, vitamin B12, anti-oxidants, and phosphorus. They all play a vital role in the metabolic process, blood circulation, energy production, anti-brain aging, as well as gastrointestinal health promotion. Meanwhile, the low content of calories, fat, and carbohydrates makes shrimp an excellent option for French Bulldogs’ diet.

However, moderation is the key. Cholesterol is abundant in shrimps, so too much shrimp will build up unhealthy amounts of cholesterol in dogs’ body.

Like fish, shrimp isn’t fit for serving raw. Cooking can prevent the penetration of harmful pathogens into your Frenchie. Remember to obliterate the shell, which poses a choking hazard. Steamed shrimp would be the best while excessive oils and fats in breaded or fried shrimps may be harmful.

### Dairy Products

As long as your pet isn’t allergic to lactose, cheese can make a great treat. However, given its high-fat content, never feed your pet on cheese too much, thereby minimizing chances of weight gain and obesity. Pay attention to toxic ingredients in some cheeses like herbs, onions, chives, and garlic.

You’d better go for low-fat options like cottage cheese, mozzarella, or soft goat cheese. Cottage cheese has the lowest fat and lactose of all kinds, meaning it has the least possibility of intestinal upset and obesity.

Peanut butter contains high-quality protein along with fats, vitamins B, and E that are good for heart health. Homemade and unsalted peanut butter would be a safe choice since the levels of sodium and sugar remain low.

### Eggs

Eggs are an excellent source of protein, amino acids, and fatty acids. Boiled or cooked eggs are dietary supplements or appealing treats for dogs in the sense that they can deal with upset stomachs.

Raw eggs are risky for dogs’ health. They can trigger the contraction of Salmonella or biotin deficiency.

Strictly follow the instruction of your veterinarian about the proper number of eggs per day to feed your pet.

### Yogurt

Plain yogurt can add something new to the daily diet of dogs as a delicious snack. However, not all breeds can digest it.

Yogurt contains active bacteria that serve to promote the digestive system. Don’t buy the products enriched with sugars and artificial sweeteners. Instead, let’s go for yogurt full of live cultures such as Greek-style or plain one given their lower levels of lactose.

### Honey

Honey is full of nutrients such as vitamins A, B, C, D, E, K, potassium, magnesium, calcium, copper, and antioxidants. A small amount of honey can deal with seasonal allergies since it helps build up immunity to allergens by introducing pollen.

Honey is also famous for its effect of soothing sore throats and stomachs. However, don’t forget to brush your pet’s teeth after feeding him on honey, or else the sugar will cause tooth decay. You shouldn’t give raw honey to puppies since their immune system is vulnerable to the presence of botulism spores. This is also true for obese or diabetic dogs.

### Popcorn

Interestingly, popcorn hardly triggers adverse reactions from French Bulldogs. A moderate amount of unbuttered, unsalted, and plain air-popped popcorn will be okay. Thus, next time, you can keep your pup beside and share with him some snacks while enjoying a movie.

Along with protein and iron, popcorn even contains thiamine and riboflavin, which contributes to healthy eye development and smooth digestion.

### Wheat And Grains

Some dogs are allergic to wheat and other grains, but if this isn’t the case with your pet, they are excellent sources of fiber, fatty acids, and proteins.
