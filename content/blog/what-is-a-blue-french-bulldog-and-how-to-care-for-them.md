# The origin of a blue French bulldog

What is the origin of a blue French Bulldog? Should we talk about the history of French bulldogs first? YES.

Despite the French element in the name, Frenchies are not actually from France, but England is where the story began.

There were lacemakers in Nottingham during 1800s tended to downside bulldogs and made them fitter for small homes. It was the industrial revolution drew a large percentage of these lacemakers and their dogs to France.

In the new land, the dogs again got crossed with a range of other dogs giving them the look we all discern today.

Blue Frenchies are not recognized worldwide by any dog breeder association. Although this genetic variant is rare, it’s considered a “fad color” by the French Bulldog Club of America.

**_Why is that?_**

People believe the rare gene that got diluted affecting the coat color is recessive thus is not encourage to continuously breeding although there is no proof for this exception to be related to the health issue.

That said, if you are thinking of getting a blue Frenchie, look for a reputable breeder that knows and loves French bulldogs at heart. Don’t just select color over health and bring home a poor little sick bullpup.

## The appearance of Blue French bulldogs

Whatever comes to debate, it’s hard to deny the uniqueness of a blue French pup. If we exclude the exceptional coat color, a blue Frenchie has all the characteristic any French bulldog has.

They have a small but robust build that weighs about 28 lbs and stands from 11 to 15 inch tall. Other than that, their erected bat-like ears and a short muzzle are similar to all dogs of this breed.

## Taking care of a blue Frenchie

### Grooming

A pleasant release when having a French bulldog is that they don’t leave too much hair on your couch but spare the shortness of the coat, Frenchies shed at a minimal rate. Thus, the dogs demand some brushings, occasionally.

Although Frenchies rank high in the list of low-maintenance dogs, keeping them clean is not a pie. It’s a matter of keeping the dog’s coat shiny and silky.

The general rule says you should bathe your dog often at least once a month. It can be once every two months if your pup is good clean boy.

It is best to use hypoallergenic shampoo if your Frenchie has sensitive skin and let him rinse thoroughly after every shower. Since the open ears of Frenchies can catch a vastness of debris, make sure you check them out and ensure they don’t emit any bad smell.

Trimming nails is an important part of grooming. Suggestions say you should clip the nails once every month.

The protruding eyes are sensitive is no secret. It’s your duty to keep this area on the face clean as well as places on the wrinkles and nose as those are vulnerable to the growth of red yeast.

You may want to equip a particular toothbrush to brush your dog’s teeth sometimes to prevent the formation of tartar. Don’t use the human toothpaste for your dog because it contains fluoride that is toxic to bulldogs.

### Training

Blue Frenchies are not off the line of intelligent and playful dogs. Their adaptable natures are the great gifts making them a fast-learning breed.

Training a blue French pup, you will appreciate the work of a teacher. They have the distinctive stubbornness that will demand a dedicated time from you.

But they are food cravers though. That means food-based training works as well as some low-energy tricks. Try not to work on cues and commands that don’t suit their low-profile builds.

### Exercising

Like any French bulldog in the world, a blue Frenchie is not a jogging buddy. That refers to their tuck-in muzzle, which gives them difficulty in breathing.

The trait hence marks them as lazy dogs as much as they should be. But not like a kitten, blue Frenchies are always up for playtime, and of course, delicious treats.

One of the most important notes is to never leave your blue French bulldog near ponds, lakes, and pools. They are not at all swimmers due to their short legs and brachycephalic face shape. That is why most Frenchies are not prone to play around water. If yours does, make sure you make the dog wear a life vest.

### Health issues

It’s probably due to the recessive gene that makes the coat blue the culprit of the dogs being weak to several allergies. But that applies to French bulldogs of any color.

The most common problems in all French Bulldogs  include skinfold dermatitis, conjunctivitis (pink eye), ear infections, and long nails. The obstructed airways of the narrow nostrils are unable to suffice air to lungs leading to some major health problems.

### Love

A blue Frenchie is not there to be ignored. The dogs, like any dog, want your love, at all time. This is for you to consider if you don’t have time to spend for a pet acknowledging that a blue Frenchie demands a lot of attention.

Many say that Frenchies will act out if they recognize your love is toward another pet in the house, even children. They don’t like the fact that you have to spare time for, say another “species.” Though it’s not hard to teach your dog to share the house and love, making everyone happy is still a heavy duty at first.

## What matters most?
