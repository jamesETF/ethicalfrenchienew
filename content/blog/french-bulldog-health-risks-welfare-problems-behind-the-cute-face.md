The French Bulldog has its name on the list of the most popular dog breeds across the UK. But the interest of owning one Frenchies doesn’t come solely with the high initial cost whatsoever; the **French bulldog health risks** are going to add up the after-expenses.

According to researchers at The Royal Veterinary College (RVC), UK, Frenchies with their brachycephalic face, are vulnerable to ear infections, diarrhea, and conjunctivitis.

Although the dogs are known to be the “healthiest” of all the “bully” breeds, treatments for any suffering can be costly.

That is why it always makes sense to get your Frenchies from [a reputable breeder](www.ethicalfrenchie.com) and invest in pet insurance.

## Common French bulldog health risks

In recent years, the dramatic rise in popularity of the Frenchies is unprecedented. Dr. O’Neill from RVC worried that it was this high-demand was damaging to the French pups’ well-being.

Some breeders are only interested in making profit and don't follow the necessary steps to assure the mating will produce healthy puppies. Extensive genetic testing needs to be done on the Dam and Sire to confirm they are 100% healthy before taking the next step.

### Allergies

When the immune system encounters an alien substance that the body is not built to endure, it becomes a state of over-reactivity called allergies.

Allergy can be a result of poor breeding and improper care. That said, your Frenchies may not be able to consume a certain type of food or intake drug.

Signs of allergies can take account in itchy and red skin, vomiting, diarrhea, inflamed throat, infected ears, paw chewing, and constant licking.

The causes could be anything like fleas, allergens in food, pollens, dander, or even your perfume. So, there is no better solution than visiting your vet when you are unsure of what is going on that makes your Frenchies suffering. Or, at least call and consult the doctor if the case is not severe.

### Brachycephalic Respiratory Syndrome

Brachycephalic, one of the most common French bulldog health risks, refers to “a short head” or “flat face.” This means the dogs have to breathe through a short muzzle and compensate by respiring through the mouth.

“When it comes to exercise, rather than going for one long off-lead walk every day, it is safer to take three shorter off-lead walks as brachycephalic breeds tire easily and find it difficult to breathe due to their short muzzles. It is important that an owner understands the needs of their pet, monitors their breathing while exercising, and takes extra precautions to ensure they don’t overdo it.”

This is the major reason for Frenchies not to be resilient to many physical efforts. Although the dogs don’t seem uncomfortable with their endowed beauty, owners should not exhaust them with extreme exercises.

### Conjunctivitis (Pinkeye)

If you see your Frenchie’s eyes are getting abnormally red, it’s the sign of the inflammation of the tissues characterized in swollen and red eyelids.

The causes can be allergies or dry eyes. You can rub the eyes of the dog to comfort the irritation. If you visit the vet, you may have anti-inflammation medications to relieve part of the pain.

_What’s dangerous is in the consequence_

Infected tissues can spread and affect other parts of the surrounding, or worse, lead to canine distemper if the case is not treated.

For bacterial infection, antibiotic medications may be prescribed. If the cause is by allergies, it is possible to apply to eliminate diet which will rule out the possible causes in foods and cut back whatever is the culprit of the sickness.

### Cherry eye

This health disorder exhibits the tear gland protruding out of the red membrane in the eyes. The swelling will grow larger and redder and later damage the eyes.

Many times the condition doesn't present a serious health issue and can be fixed with a gentle massage. In extreme cases vet will recommend surgery to remove the tear gland. However, the postoperative result can develop dry eyes for the rest of the days.

But don’t leave this sickness untreated or it can seriously impair your Frenchie’s vision and grow a horrible discomfort in the long run.

### Heat stress

Frenchies’ smushed faces again bring them one more common health issue prevailing in body temperature regulation.

The dogs usually struggle to cool themselves when the degree is up. This difficulty associated with the short face in which Frenchies can’t release the heat off efficiently, eventually leading to heat stroke. Avoid playing outside during the hot summer weather. I recommend skipping the dog park during the day and scheduling it either early morning or after 7 PM.

To know if your French pup is suffering the heat stress, notice if he is panting excessively, in convulsions or even vomiting.

In the presence of those uncomfortable symptoms, immediately move your dog to a cooler area or at least provide some shades. Gently massage the dog’s legs and cool him down with cold pad. It is possible to place him in a bathtub if there is any.

### Hip dysplasia

The skeletal disorder results in the disposition of socket joints of the hip. It is the first form of hip arthritis and many chronic joint pains in the long run.It’s not hard to observe the irregularity like “bunny hopping,” hip sensitivity, inability to climb stairs, unwillingness to join activities, or difficulty in standing up.

Hip dysplasia occurs in rather bulky Frenchies than dogs with well-proportioned bodies. It can also due to environmental factors or a genetic predisposition to cause the disorder to happen.

Treatments for such ailment can be physical therapy and diet control. A healthy diet will surely minimize the chance of meeting this illness.

Otherwise, a hip dysplasia surgery for French bulldog can cost from $1,600 to $5,000. The operation procedures depend on the pooch’s age, namely:

· Juvenile Pubic Symphysiodesis (JPS): for pups if 10 and 18 weeks old

· Double or Triple Pelvic Osteotomy (DPO/TPO): dogs of less than 8-10 months of age

· Total Hip Replacement (THR): Frenchies of at least a year old

· Femoral Head Ostectomy (FHO): for any age

### Deafness - Irresponsible Breeding Practices

The inability to hear can come from genetic defects. It also happens in senior dogs. People reckon extreme pied French Bulldogs, the dogs with genes associated with the lack of pigment cells, are the kind that is prone to this hearing loss.

It could be funny to think how the color affects the listening ability, but there are indeed little hairs called cilia doesn’t grow without the presence of pigment cells causing deafness in Frenchies. The high risk is present in dogs who are all white, or Pied French Bulldogs with little to no markings in the ear area.

A responsible breeder will make sure the Dam and Sire are a genetic match before mating them to avoid this from happening.

You can take your dog to a clinic and request a BAER test to diagnose the hearing ability for French pups as young as 6 weeks old.

## Last words

Taking care of a brachycephalic pet is not a picnic work. It requires extreme care and love; on the other side is finance and patience to look after the **French Bulldog health risks**.

That said, please think responsibly before you want to adopt a French bulldog. Consider if you have enough time and money to give the dog a healthy yet fulfilled life.

Also, never think you can get a Frenchies under $500 or else it’s a scam. Remember that poor breeding is the primary trigger of many negatives that come after. So, don’t buy or encourage any cheap breeder even with exclusive deals.
