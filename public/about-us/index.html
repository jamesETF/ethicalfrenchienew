Our breeding program is focused on extra care, socialization and improving the breed. We aren’t your typical “Mom and Pops breeder” that has been around for 20 years. We are started breeding 3 years ago but expanded our program in 2018. We are responsible, knowledgeable and caring which makes us stand out in the sea of faulty backyard breeders and puppy mills."

After getting one of our puppies we offer life-time support when it comes to caring and raising your new baby. If something happens you won’t be left alone in the dark – we will assist you, so you can reach out anytime."

We also breed to better the breed. Most of our dogs are sold as pet only. We won’t offer full AKC registration on each and every puppy – that’s not a responsible thing to do. We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out. Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money for it. Not all dogs are meant to be bred. Some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the “standard” French Bulldog look.</p><p>Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.</p>"

        "description": "Newborn French Bulldog puppies require extra care. The first 10 days of their life are crucial. Puppies can fade away in an instant if you aren’t present at all times. Making sure they eat every 2 hours, that their temperature doesn’t drop, that they are all gaining weight equally and of course just observing their overall behavior – not missing something that would indicate a major health issue. But of course, the whole process of “producing a healthy French Bulldog” starts way before they are even conceived. Health testing the parents is the responsible thing to do. The last thing you would want is take a risk of dam or sire being a carrier or them having some kind of hereditary condition, that would only bring heartbreak and vet bills to the new potential family. After the French bulldog puppies are old enough, they get their first extensive vet visit. Only after their well being is confirmed and documented is when we start advertising our puppies/taking deposits.",

        "description": "The socialization of your French Bulldog puppy starts early. Since they are raised inside the house they get exposed to variety of sounds and people as soon as their “ears open” at around 10-14 days of age. Yes, all puppies are born deaf and blind – they rely on their sense of smell to crawl around and find their mother during “feeding time”. It’s hard to believe but some puppies show their dominance and alpha qualities at a very early age. We pay special attention to those and make sure we don’t enforce those traits. We try to establish ourselves as the leader of the pack, which will make your training easier once the puppy is in your care. By the time they are ready they understand the concept of peeing on the pee pad and those that stay with us longer are familiar with the “potty” command. Some are more stubborn than others, so consistency with training is key. You can read more about French Bulldog potty training here(https://ethicalfrenchie.com/potty-train-your-frenchie/). Overall exposing the puppies to positive and versatile experiences is what will predispose them to grow into stable, happy individuals with the absence of phobias and behavioral issues.",

We, by no means want to increase this number, so we ask our potential buyers to please research the breed or ask as many questions as possible. We want to make sure the puppy is a match for your home, and that you will commit to accepting your new addition and caring for it for the next 10+ years. Don’t get one because it’s a trend, or because your neighbor has one and they look cute. They are funny and quirky but also delicate and require a lot of work. If you feel like your heart is in the right place and you are ready for the responsibility, we want you to know that we donate a portion of each puppy purchase to an organization of your or our choice. That way you aren’t only opening your home to a new puppy, but are also helping an abandoned neglected one that wasn’t as fortunate.",

Let me just say, I spoke to a few different breeders and Renee and James are the only two that I could tell genuinely LOVE their puppies. From the moment I spoke with Renee through e-mail she was very informative and as soon as I asked for videos she send me them instantly! With the video alone you could just hear the love and see how happy then pups are! Also, after I got my puppy Renee has been checking in on him, making sure to answer any questions I have and has been suggesting so many things for my pup which really confirms how much she cares about all the puppies and wants them to find a great home. Thank you so much again for our little Zack, we appreciate you guys so much!!"

    </div>
  </div>
<div class="col-12 content px-0 text-white">Hi! We’re James &amp; Renee (and now Ely!), nice to meet you. We are a small, exclusive French Bulldog breeder based out of North Carolina, but have breeding homes in North Carolina, Manhattan, NY, and Santa Fe, NM via our Decentralized Breeding system (puppyback). Our breeding program is focused on extra care, socialization and improving the breed. We aren’t your typical “Mom and Pops breeder” that has been around for 20 years. We are started breeding 3 years ago but expanded our program in 2018. We are responsible, knowledgeable and caring which makes us stand out in the sea of faulty backyard breeders and puppy mills.</div>

  </div>
<div class="col-12 content px-0 text-white">We’re passionate about what we do, but more importantly we understand the frustrations of searching high and low while trying to avoid scams and puppy mills alike. We work diligently to ensure that we are following the best French Bulldog breeding practices and work extra hard to make sure your future family member is healthy &amp; socialized to fit your specific family’s needs. After getting one of our puppies we offer life-time support when it comes to caring and raising your new baby. If something happens you won’t be left alone in the dark – we will assist you, so you can reach out anytime.</div>

      <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
    </div>
  </div>
<div class="col-12 content px-0 text-white"><p>We started Ethical Frenchie because of what we saw as a lack of transparency and the proliferation of scam artists taking advantage of people when they are most vulnerable. We also breed to better the breed. Most of our dogs are sold as pet only. We won’t offer full AKC registration on each and every puppy – that’s not a responsible thing to do. We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out. Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money for it. Not all dogs are meant to be bred. Some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the “standard” French Bulldog look.</p>

<p>Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.</p>

Puppies can fade away in an instant if you aren’t present at all times. Making sure they eat every 2 hours, that their temperature doesn’t drop, that they are all gaining weight equally and of course just observing their overall behavior – not missing something that would indicate a major health issue.</p>

<p>But of course, the whole process of “producing a healthy French Bulldog” starts way before they are even conceived. Health testing the parents is the responsible thing to do. The last thing you would want is take a risk of dam or sire being a carrier or them having some kind of hereditary condition, that would only bring heartbreak and vet bills to the new potential family.</p>

<p>After the French bulldog puppies are old enough, they get their first extensive vet visit. Only after their well being is confirmed and documented is when we start advertising our puppies/taking deposits.</p>

          <div class="mb-0 text-body"><p>The socialization of your French Bulldog puppy starts early. Since they are raised inside the house they get exposed to variety of sounds and people as soon as their “ears open” at around 10-14 days of age. Yes, all puppies are born deaf and blind – they rely on their sense of smell to crawl around and find their mother during “feeding time”.</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe but some puppies show their dominance and alpha qualities at a very early age. We pay special attention to those and make sure we don’t enforce those traits. We try to establish ourselves as the leader of the pack, which will make your training easier once the puppy is in your care.</p>

<p>By the time they are ready they understand the concept of peeing on the pee pad and those that stay with us longer are familiar with the “potty” command. Some are more stubborn than others, so consistency with training is key. <a href="/potty-train-your-frenchie">You can read more about French Bulldog potty training here.</a></p>

<p>Overall exposing the puppies to positive and versatile experiences is what will predispose them to grow into stable, happy individuals with the absence of phobias and behavioral issues.</p>

We want to make sure the puppy is a match for your home, and that you will commit to accepting your new addition and caring for it for the next 10+ years. Don’t get one because it’s a trend, or because your neighbor has one and they look cute. They are funny and quirky but also delicate and require a lot of work.</p>

<p>If you feel like your heart is in the right place and you are ready for the responsibility, we want you to know that we donate a portion of each puppy purchase to an organization of your or our choice.

              I went through all different kind of breeders trying to find my forever family.Sadly I did not get any respond....until I found Renee and James!!!!!!!I was at work and sent a message thinking i’ll look to see if I get a reply later.Renee answered in 5 seconds with full details and what I am looking for and my history with dogs.She was so open for me to go to her place and meet the puppies and feel it out. She did not demand any deposit or make me feel the need to take a puppy home. She told me it was perfectly fine to wait for the next litter if I didn’t find any.The best breeder and helpful to all the puppies she sent out !!!I highly recommend anyone who wants a good frenchie with great temperament!!!!!!

              My partner and I purchased a French Bulldog from them last year and had a great experience. They allowed us to visit their home and interact with the dogs to make sure we find the perfect match. The puppies mother was on the spot and was extremely social and approved of us playing with her babies. Peach has been super healthy and didn’t require any vet visits other than the regulars shots! We are planning on adding another Frenchie to our clan in the future and will definitely reach out to you guys soon!!

              We found James and Renee to be extremely knowledgeable about this breed. We felt very comfortable working with them as such experienced breeders. It was obvious that they care very much about each puppy that is placed and follow up. We are happy to be part of the Ethical Frenchie Family! We absolutely adore our Sweet Violette !

              We couldn&#39;t be happier with the experience we had working with Renee and James! They are both very knowledgeable and a joy to work with. E-mailing, texting, and chatting on the phone was very easy with them! We couldn&#39;t love our little Frenchie more! Renee stays in touch even after the puppy purchasing process is complete. She will pass along advice and tips to help as the puppy grows. We are very grateful! Thanks again Renee and James for our little girl Charley Rose!

              So I recently go to my baby Frenchie from Renee and James and it has been such an amazing experience! Let me just say, I spoke to a few different breeders and Renee and James are the only two that I could tell genuinely LOVE their puppies. From the moment I spoke with Renee through e-mail she was very informative and as soon as I asked for videos she send me them instantly! With the video alone you could just hear the love and see how happy then pups are! Also, after I got my puppy Renee has been checking in on him, making sure to answer any questions I have and has been suggesting so many things for my pup which really confirms how much she cares about all the puppies and wants them to find a great home. Thank you so much again for our little Zack, we appreciate you guys so much!!

              Renee and James at Ethical Frenchie were such a joy to work with when it came to choosing our little Pickle. They are professional, kind, accommodating and answered all of my questions confidently without hesitation. We brought Pickle home in January of 2019 and Renee still continues to check up on Pickle. If you’re looking for a well-bred French Bulldog you’ve come to the right breeders at Ethical Frenchie as they uphold the highest standards. I high recommend these lovely people!
