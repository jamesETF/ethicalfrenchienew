The Honest Kitchen Beef Recipe. It’s a dehydrated raw human grade food in a form of a powder that you rehydrate with warm water. You can always add some fresh blueberries, chia seeds and other vegetables to your dogs meal. When i decided to write the 13 best dog food brands post, Honest Kitchen was probably the first one to pop up in my head.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"open-farm-freeze-dried-raw-food\"\u003eOpen Farm Freeze Dried Raw Food\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/Open-farm.jpg\" alt=\"Open Farm\" title=\"Open-farm\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany French Bulldog owners swear by the raw diet.

We really like this Beef raw coated Formula. Price is fair and your French Bulldog will thrive on this one for sure. No fillers that lead to allergies. I suggest you check the ingredients on the current kibble you are feeding, you might be surprised at the amount of fillers it contains.
