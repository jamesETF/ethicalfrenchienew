We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out. Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money for it. Not all dogs are meant to be bred. Some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the “standard” French Bulldog look.</p><p>Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.</p>"

        "description": "Newborn French Bulldog puppies require extra care. The first 10 days of their life are crucial. Puppies can fade away in an instant if you aren’t present at all times. Making sure they eat every 2 hours, that their temperature doesn’t drop, that they are all gaining weight equally and of course just observing their overall behavior – not missing something that would indicate a major health issue. But of course, the whole process of “producing a healthy French Bulldog” starts way before they are even conceived. Health testing the parents is the responsible thing to do. The last thing you would want is take a risk of dam or sire being a carrier or them having some kind of hereditary condition, that would only bring heartbreak and vet bills to the new potential family. After the French bulldog puppies are old enough, they get their first extensive vet visit. Only after their well being is confirmed and documented is when we start advertising our puppies/taking deposits.",

        "description": "The socialization of your French Bulldog puppy starts early. Since they are raised inside the house they get exposed to variety of sounds and people as soon as their “ears open” at around 10-14 days of age. Yes, all puppies are born deaf and blind – they rely on their sense of smell to crawl around and find their mother during “feeding time”. It’s hard to believe but some puppies show their dominance and alpha qualities at a very early age. We pay special attention to those and make sure we don’t enforce those traits. We try to establish ourselves as the leader of the pack, which will make your training easier once the puppy is in your care. By the time they are ready they understand the concept of peeing on the pee pad and those that stay with us longer are familiar with the “potty” command. Some are more stubborn than others, so consistency with training is key. You can read more about French Bulldog potty training here(https://ethicalfrenchie.com/potty-train-your-frenchie/). Overall exposing the puppies to positive and versatile experiences is what will predispose them to grow into stable, happy individuals with the absence of phobias and behavioral issues.",

Don’t get one because it’s a trend, or because your neighbor has one and they look cute. They are funny and quirky but also delicate and require a lot of work. If you feel like your heart is in the right place and you are ready for the responsibility, we want you to know that we donate a portion of each puppy purchase to an organization of your or our choice.

Let me just say, I spoke to a few different breeders and Renee and James are the only two that I could tell genuinely LOVE their puppies. From the moment I spoke with Renee through e-mail she was very informative and as soon as I asked for videos she send me them instantly! With the video alone you could just hear the love and see how happy then pups are! Also, after I got my puppy Renee has been checking in on him, making sure to answer any questions I have and has been suggesting so many things for my pup which really confirms how much she cares about all the puppies and wants them to find a great home. Thank you so much again for our little Zack, we appreciate you guys so much!!"
