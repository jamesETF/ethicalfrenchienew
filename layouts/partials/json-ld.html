We also breed to better the breed. Most of our dogs are sold as pet only. We won’t offer full AKC registration on each and every puppy – that’s not a responsible thing to do. We will however offer full breeding rights if a puppy from the litter catches our eye and stands out. Too many people are trying to earn an extra buck by selling their dogs with a full AKC registration to get more money for it. Not all dogs are meant to be bred. Some of them lack the “structure”, others are too small or too big and don’t fall under the “standard” French Bulldog look.</p><p>Full AKC will also only be offered to an ethical, in house breeder, that has the same vision of bettering the breed, after being extensively screened by us. We would hate for our dogs to end up in hands for someone who lacks knowledge or is only in it for profit.</p>"
